Within the folders labelled ClientFolder and ServerFolder:
Open your linux distributor or follow the setting up SFML instructions in the CSC481 001 moodle (I used WSL:Ubuntu-20.04)
so that you have one terminal for ServerFolder and four terminals for ClientFolders

**If main files aren't compiled, which it should be already, type the following two commands in the terminal**
    1: make clean
    2: make


Instructions on how to run program(s):

in the linux terminal opened in ServerFolder, type the following to run the program: ./main
(give the server a second to start)
in the first linux terminal opened in ClientFolder, type the following to run the program: ./main
in the second linux terminal opened in ClientFolder, type the following to run the program: ./main
in the third linux terminal opened in ClientFolder, type the following to run the program: ./main
in the fourth linux terminal opened in ClientFolder, type the following to run the program: ./main

You should now have four synchronized client windows that take input when the window is open/focused


Ctrl + C to stop any terminal left running when closing programs
